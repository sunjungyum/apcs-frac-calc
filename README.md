# apcs-frac-calc
This project builds a calculator that does basic operations on fractions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and devision. The inputs may include mixed numbers, proper or improper fractions, or integers. It also reduces the final answer to its lowest terms, as a whole number if possible, as a proper fraction if it's not a whole number, and as a mixed number if it's not a proper fraction. For an extra challenge, this program also robustly handles errors and provides help content if the user types "help."

Assigned as a project in the AP Computer Science A curriculum.
